# Take Home Test from Canonical

## Libraries

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - The task didn't mention any specific UI library, so I chose React because that's the one I'm most familiar with, but I can redo the task using vanilla HTML/JS or any other flavour.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
  - Performant, simple, and straight forward.
- [Vanilla-framework](https://vanillaframework.io/)
  - Using this library is part of the task.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
  - To be able to use vanilla-framework

> **_NOTE:_**  I didn't use any library for http requests, because there's only 1 request, so there's no need to bloat the project, but for more complex scenarios I would probably use [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) or [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky).

To run the dev server, run `npm run dev`, and to see the build output run `npm run build && npm run preview`.
